        If you've found a security vulnerability in StatusPulse, **please do not open a public issue**.  
        
        Instead, report it privately via [GitHub's Security Advisory](https://github.com/TheSnakeByte/StatusPulse/security/advisories) to ensure responsible disclosure.  
        
        Thank you for helping keep StatusPulse secure!
